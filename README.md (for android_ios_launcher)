# 📱 App Launcher (Android & iOS)

This tool helps QA engineers **quickly launch Android and iOS apps** using Appium by setting the required **desired capabilities**.

---

## 💡 Why Is This Useful?

Before running mobile automation tests, the app must be launched on a device or emulator. This script sets up all the required settings and connects to the Appium server to open the app.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Appium server running on `localhost:4723`
- `appium-python-client` installed:
```bash
pip install Appium-Python-Client




🧠 How It Works

The script uses desired capabilities, such as:

| Capability       | Description                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `platformName`   | OS of the device (`Android` or `iOS`)          |
| `deviceName`     | Name of emulator or real device                |
| `appPackage`     | (Android) Unique package name of the app       |
| `appActivity`    | (Android) Main activity to be launched         |
| `bundleId`       | (iOS) Unique identifier of the app             |
| `automationName` | Automation engine: `UiAutomator2` / `XCUITest` |



🧪 Sample Use Cases

    Launch app before running tests

    Sanity check if app installs and opens properly

    Troubleshoot app startup issues



🔧 Notes

    Ensure your emulator/simulator or device is running

    Appium server must be started first:

bash:
appium
